Just like your traditional paper lab notebook, you can store sketches of data as it's being explored.

We use the file format:

`[ISO 8601 date]-[DS-initials]-[2-4 word description].ipynb`

For example:

`2017-06-28-fc-initial-data-clean.ipynb`

- Each Notebook keeps a historical record of analysis being recorded.
- This notebook is not meant to be anything other than a place for experiments
- This notebook is controlled by a single author (marked with their initials in the filename)
- Notebooks can be split up if they get too long
- Notebooks can be split up by topic, if it makes sense to do so.
